What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new repository is created. At this time there are no commits made. We need to do this to create a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an intermidiate between working disrectory and repository. It allows us to aggregate all the files in a single commit as a memory and then commit the logical files together in the repository.
